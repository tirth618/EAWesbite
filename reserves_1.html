						<h2>What Does Adequate Shelter Mean?</h2>
                      <p>To begin with, what does adequate shelter really entail? According to the bill presented to the House of Commons in 2012, adequate shelter means, “the right of every woman, man, youth and child to gain and sustain a safe and secure home and community in which to live in peace and dignity.”
                         Going beyond this, adequate shelter means there is accessibility to vital places, such as hospitals, schools, and other important places. As an extension of that, these vital places should also be in a condition to serve the community. In places where adequate shelter is provided, 
                         basic human rights would also be expected to be provided as well, such as the right to clean water to drink, cook and clean with. Another basic human right of safety would also fall under this, as the shelter could not be considered on par if it was always filled with mold, and continuously at the risk of falling apart at any time.

						<h2>What is the Shelter Really Like?</h2>
                      <p>Considering that the right to shelter is a right that should be afforded to everyone no matter their race or origin, it would be fair to say that people of Indigenous communities should also have this right to shelter that was defined.
                         However, life on Indigenous reserves can be seen to be the polar opposite of what was defined to be adequate shelter. For starters, many people do not even have shelter and end up having to sleep on the streets, and scramble the best they can for any food or water they can find. 
                         Even for the people who manage to find shelter, the conditions are still terrible. The water reserves for these houses are inadequate, old, and in dire need of change, as the water that comes into most houses is inconsumable, making it almost impossible to cook with as well. 
                         Accessibility to vital places was also identified as an extension of adequate shelter. However, in most shelters, there is not even a single hospital, meaning that in the case of an emergency, people would have to travel for hours to get any sort of medical attention. 
                         While there are some hospitals on the reserves, they are severely understaffed and underfunded. The schooling system is also in dire need of change, with only a few schools in a reserve with a small number of teachers. 
                         The shelters themselves are also overcrowded, due to the limited number of them, causing them to be on the brink of collapse, and filled with mold at all times. 
                         While not all reserves and shelters are like this, the larger majority of them are, raising the cause for concern.

                      <h2>Why Is this Important?</h2>
                      <p>This issue is important as it is a grave violation of the most basic and fundamental human rights. Not only does it violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms,
                         but it also violates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In both the UDHR and the Charter, the right to “essential public services of a reasonable quality” is a protected right to all citizens.
                         Essential public services such as hospitals and schools, both which are understaffed, underfunded and barely accessible, do not constitute reasonable at all. Along with this, the dire living conditions of the reserves endanger the lives of all indigenous peoples on reserves, 
                         violating the international right of safety. The water conditions of the reserves has led to many Indigenous peoples catching diseases and illnesses. Due to the essential need of water, people are forced to consume the contaminated water, 
                         which has many deadly consequences. Many waterborne diseases and illnesses have become common among reserves as a result of the unsanitary water. Along with this, there is a massive lack in medical infrastructure which causes residents to be unable to get treated as needed, causing them to pass away on these reserves.
                         This constant threat to life, solely due to living on the conditions is an unprecedented issue, one that requires immediate attention and mediation. </p>
