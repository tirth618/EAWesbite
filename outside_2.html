                    <h1>Life Outside Of The Reserves</h1>
                    <p>There are many dire living conditions that Indigenous people face inside the reserves, so the question can then be asked, why do they simply not leave the reserves? 
                      The housing crisis for Indigenous people is just as bad outside the reserves. Due to discriminatory practices, along with the overall Canadian housing market, 
                      finding housing is nearly impossible.

						<h2>Finding A Stable Source of Income Outside the Reserves</h2>
                      <p>Finding housing outside of the reserves has continued to become increasingly difficult. With housing pricing soaring and the large number of misconceptions about the Indigenous community, it becomes nearly impossible to find any sort of affordable housing. 
                        Firstly, to be able to even try to afford any sort of housing, they would need a stable source of income; or a job. However, even finding a job is very difficult for most Indigenous people, as when these names come across agencies and companies, 
                        they often have misconceptions that lead them to not hiring any Indigenous people. There have been multiple studies and reports into the exact discrimination that most Indigenous people face when trying to find work. In a study where 2 identical resumes were given, 
                        but with a white name and an Indigenous name, it was found that the white name was almost always chosen, and the other name was not even considered. Due to this outright discrimination, Indigenous people do not have a shot to even begin with.</p>
                      <p>In addition to that, even if they succeed in that daunting task of finding work, it is hard for them to keep them. Multiple articles have stated that many supervisors and managers penalize Indigenous people more for any mistakes and are much harder then. 
                        This bias and discrimination has made it very hard for Indigenous people to feel pscholgically unsafe at work, with their job never secure. People even change their names and try to go by different names so that they have a better chance of finding work. </p>
                      <p>Moreover, in a study conducted by Stats-Canada, in 2018, only 66% of eligible off reserve Indignous people, from the age of 25-65 had a job. This meant that a third of the entire off reserve population did not have a job at all, and could not provide a stable income for themselves or their families. 
                        Furthermore, of this 66% of people who did have jobs, many of these jobs would not even suffice enough for them to feed their families. In that same study, it was also found that 42% of all off-reserve Indigenous people had food insecurity, and were not able to even afford food on a daily basis. 
                        While these statistics are bad enough as is, due to the current state of the country, prices for everything continue to skyrocket, and more and more Indigenous people end up on the streets without any sort of shelter. </p>

						<h2>Finding Housing Outside the Reserves</h2>
                      <p>The fact that a great part of the population does not a stable income already makes it very hard for Indigenous people to find housing; however, the further discriminatory practices even when trying to find housing make that task even harder. 
                        While there are specific shelters for Indigenous people outside of the reserve, these shelters are often also overcrowded and hard to get into. To get into these shelters, one must have a Status Indian card, a very frustrating and often unsuccessful task. 
                        The person would have to prove that they are from Indigenous background, and without the proper tools, this is very difficult. The records from the past relating to most Indigenous people are also very hard to come by, or simply do not exist, so it is very difficult to prove that relation. </p>
                      <p>If they can’t get accepted into these shelters, they have to look for other housing methods, which are all very expensive. The cheapest option would be to find housing in an apartment or somewhere rent controlled. However landlords and other owners also have a prejudice against Indigenous people, 
                        and often refrain from renting out their properties to anyone Indigenous. As a result of this, people have to hide their true identity so that they are not discriminated against in the process of finding housing or work. 
                        The fact that many Indigenous people feel that it is necessary to oppress their own identity simply just to find a house or a job, is a clear indication of the dire consequences of the discrimination that they face. </p>

                      <h2>The Implications</h2>
                      <p>These harsh conditions to find housing have caused thousands of Indigenous people to be homeless on the streets. Only 2% of the Toronto population is Indigenous; however about 20% of all people who are homeless in Toronto, are Indigenous. 
                        This statistic shows that it’s not just a small amount of the population that are unable to find housing, but it has come to the point where more often than not, someone will always have some sort of issue with finding or maintaining any type of housing.
