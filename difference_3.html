                <p>Seeing the dire conditions that thousands of indeginous people have to go through everyday, it is evident that there needs to be widespread change, as this is a violation of not only their constitutional rights, but their fundamental human rights as well. <br><br>

                  As this is a Nationwide issue that needs to be addressed by the federal government, there is little we can do to actually physically intervene, or improve the state of the housing and actually make a difference that way. However, there are other ways that we can try to make a difference that could cause the same impact on the issue. <br><br>
                  
                  The first thing to do; is to simply listen. This issue has been advocated for by Indeginous activists for decades now, but it has not gotten nearly as much attention as it should have. There have been many claims by the indigenous people that the public has not paid any regard to, but these claims are continuing to be proven, claims that show the massive human rights violations going on for decades. The first hand stories of the things Indeginous people suffer provide great insight into what is happening, and these stories are enough to shock anyone. However, with not many people listening or even willing to hear these stories, these voices do not get heard, and as a cause of this, the terrible conditions of the reserves are not known to the general public. <br><br>
                  
                  Once we listen to the stories, we can understand what is going on, and use this to protest and spread our own awareness on the issue. Recently, the true horror of residential schools was brought to light, and after seeing these horrors, the public ensured that the government took action. Similar to this, if the stories of this crisis come out, and are actually heard by everyone, people will start to spread awareness and protest, something which has proven to cause significant change. The reconciliation project that happened as a result of the protests of the children who passed away, is one of the largest projects to date, and a huge step forward in improving the conditions that Indigenous people face daily. However, it is still far from right, and since these human rights violations still exist, we should do everything in our power to ensure we can help in making this issue right. <br><br>
                  
                  Lastly, if we are not able to do anything like help protest or anything like that, we can still make a difference from our homes. We can do this by just spreading awareness on things like social media, as this has also been a proven way in helping. Just simply reposting a post could inform a few people on the issue, and this would help immensely. We can also sign petitions and donate to other charitable organizations that are trying to help with this issue. <br><br>
                  
                  There are many ways that we can help make a difference through the ways described above, but the most important thing we can do, is to stop discriminating in away way against indigenous people. There are very false prejudices of indigenous people out there, which leads to discrimination that costs them things like work and housing. By simply changing your perspective and losing the unfounded prejudices that we have, we can help immensely in changing the narrative about indigenous people, a huge step in the right direction of solving this issue.
